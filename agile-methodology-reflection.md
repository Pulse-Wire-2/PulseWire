# Agile Methodology Reflection

## Reflect on your team's communication processes. How did Agile practices, such as daily stand-up meetings, facilitate communication and collaboration among team members?

- Izzy: "The stand-up meeting progress helps us maintain constant communication and allows us to know when we were falling behind, helping us tackle those setbacks to get back on track."

- Allan: "It helped me to brainstorm ideas before we had any code done, which was a huge plus."

## How did maintaining a scrum board play a role in the organization and delegation of tasks in your project?

- Allan: "Even though the scrum board for this particular project didn't seem that valuable to use, it made me realize the importance of keeping track of tasks as I was able to see how this could potentially be very useful in large-scale projects."

- Izzy: "I didn't really use the scrum board, since the checklist gives us a step-by-step walkthrough of the task we needed to create. However, I did use the scrum board and was able to visually see the tasks, which made it easier to remember what I needed to do."

## Reflect on your team's prioritization of tasks. How did your team create a timeline for reaching MVP and how did this prioritization assist in accomplishing your goals?

- Izzy:” we focus on the mvp features first, and leave everything else for the third day. We made The main functionality. We also used the checklist to ensure we were meeting deadlines which helped contribute to our goal.

- Allan: “ similar to what izzy said, the focus on the main functionality to then focus on the other aspect on the project did help pave to getting the project accomplished by the deadline ‘

## What would you have done differently as a group to improve your communication, prioritization, or delegation of tasks?

- Izzy: "Communication was fine. I think that when it comes to tasks, getting them done as soon as we say they're going to get done should be a priority."

- Allan: "For me, being able to contribute more of my ideas based on the task is something I would like to do more of. Also, my lack of getting things done when we said they were going to be done is something I would like to improve upon."
